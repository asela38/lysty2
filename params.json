{"name":"Lysty","tagline":"The Music Player for the Lazy!","body":"Lysty brings in 2 key features which enables a unique music listening experience:\r\n\r\n## InfiniPlay:\r\n\r\nOn InfiniPlay mode, when the song(s) you played finish, Lysty will find matching songs that suits the flow and add them to the current playlist (and again, when those songs also complete and so on). This way, you don't have to keep on brainstorming songs to play next all the time.\r\n\r\n## Partial Playlists: \r\n           _Where cup half filled is better than full_\r\n\r\nCreating playlists require a lot of effort. And once made, you have to listen to the same song set again and again. With lystys' Partial Playlists, you fill the playlist only partially by dropping a few songs to desired locations in the playlist. The half baked playlist is filled and played on the fly, so every time you load it, it will be a different but similar playlist!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
